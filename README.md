# **UX DESIGN**

- ## **Strategy**

  A Taste of Lisbon is a small restaurant that lacks an online presence and would like to increase the engagement with its customers and potential customers through an online platform. As such they have identified the following areas of opportunity:

    - Create an online presence
    - Interact with current/potential customers
    - Create a recipes blog
    - Creat an online reservation mechanism
    - Showcase their menu

  ### Site Objectives:

    - Interact with the users
    - Display key information to the users
    - Attract more customers

  ### User Needs:

    - Quick and intuitive navigation
    - Easy access to key information
    - Quick and hassle-free processes(register, reservation, etc...)

- ## **User stories**
